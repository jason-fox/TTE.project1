## Demo
#### Install
In order to install the components of our demo, follow the instructions provided in this file: [Installation & Administration Guide](installationguide.md)
```
Within the docs folder, the "installationguide.md" is to be filled with information on how to install the demo components
and their dependencies.

A convenient simulator or simulated/dummy datasets will be contributed when the source code, binaries, and/or functionality
of a given component cannot be shared as part of the public demo due to privacy- or deployment-related issues.
```

#### Usage
Information about how to use the demo components can be found in the [User & Programmers Manual](usermanual.md).
```
Within the docs folder, the "installationguide.md" is to be filled with information on how to use and configure the
components of the demo.
```

#### API
Detailed descriptions of the demo component APIs are available in the [API documentation](api.md) 
```
Within the docs folder, the "api.md" is to be filled with the definition of component APIs.

Special emphasis will be put on the description of NGSI APIs, providing tas many details as possible on the 
the subscriptions, registrations, requests, and responses associated with each component of the demo. 

Non-NGSI APIs will be fully described only if they define an interface to an NGSI-Compliant component.

Non-NGSI APIs in charge of enabling interfaces between components that are totally opaque from the NGSI
point of view will be listed and/or shortly described if they are of relevance to understand, install or
use the demo.
```

#### Testing

```
How to test the component

For performing a basic end-to-end test, you have to follow the step below. A detailed description about how to run tests can be found [here].
